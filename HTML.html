            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1930: </strong>His friend and inspiration Christopher Collan Morcom dies

                <strong>1931 - 1934: </strong>Turing studied as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge,
                where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1939: </strong> He solved the essential part of the naval indicator
                system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1946: </strong>Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)
                by King George VI for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1946: </strong>He presented a paper which was the first detailed design of a
                stored-program computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1949: </strong>He became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he
                worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers, the Manchester Mark 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1949: </strong>Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an
                experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine
                to be called "intelligent".
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1954: </strong>Dies at the age of 41.
